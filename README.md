Laptop Pricing Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes laptop pricing trends using Python. It involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to identify key factors influencing laptop prices.

This project is part of the Data Analyst Track from IBM, which I studied on Coursera.

📊 Dataset

Source: IBM Laptop Pricing Dataset

Features: Manufacturer, Category, Screen Size, GPU, OS, CPU Frequency, RAM, Storage, Weight, Price

Objective: Understand how various features impact laptop pricing.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

GitHub (for version control)

🏗️ Key Steps in Analysis

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing values using median and mode imputation

Convert categorical and numerical data types

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generate summary statistics

Analyze correlation between features

Data Visualization

Distribution of laptop prices (Histogram & KDE)

Feature correlation matrix (Heatmap)

Price vs RAM (Boxplot)

Business Insights & Recommendations

Identify key pricing factors

Provide data-driven insights for laptop manufacturers

📈 Key Findings

RAM & CPU Frequency have the highest correlation with laptop price.

Most laptops fall within the $500 - $1500 price range.

Premium laptops ($2500+) are rare, indicating a niche market.
